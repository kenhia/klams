## kproject conventions

This project uses the kproject minimal harness
(<https://github.com/kenhia/kprojects>). Keep context small; prefer doing
over ceremony.

### Layout

- `sprints/` — the project's evolution, one record per PR-sized unit of
  work (a "sprint")
  - `planning/` — planning docs; at minimum `roadmap.md` (the general plan)
  - `review/` — more formal reviews as the project matures
  - sprint records: `###-<short-name>.md` for small projects, or a
    `###-<short-name>/` directory of files for larger/more formal ones
  - a sprint record is one informal narrative: goal, decisions, what
    shipped, follow-ups — written during the sprint, not after
- `docs/` — project documentation, architecture, usage
- `.scratch/` — git-ignored scratch space for user or agent ephemera;
  use it instead of /tmp
- `justfile` — dev recipes; default recipe is `@just --list`; `just check`
  runs the CI gates; `just deploy` (or variants) if the project deploys
- `.env` — git-ignored; tokens and environment vars

### Workflow

- One sprint ≈ one PR. Sprint proposals and work items are managed in
  `korg`; durable cross-project knowledge goes in `klams`.
- If the korg or klams MCP tools are unavailable in your session, say so
  up front — don't silently work around missing infrastructure.
- TDD preferred: write the failing test first when practical.

### Tooling preferences

- Rust managed by `cargo`; format with `cargo fmt`, lint with
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` (test targets included deliberately — a gate
  that skips them is a gate that lies)
- Mirror `rust-toolchain.toml`, `rustfmt.toml` and `clippy.toml` from a
  sibling homelab repo rather than generating them
- License is MIT unless specifically directed otherwise
